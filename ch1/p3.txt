Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?

Yes, each link is an object and the arrows (i.e. functions) are the connections to each website. 
The act of clicking on a link takes you to another website. 
There is composition present as well. 

Let 'A', 'B', 'C' be websites respectively 

A -> B 
B -> C 

Thus we can go from A to C through B.
